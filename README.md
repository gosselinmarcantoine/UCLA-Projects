More information can be found in the syllabus within this repository.

## Note on Capstone project:
I can see many ways to improve the project. As you can see from the commented section, I planned on adding another widget to the second page that would allow a user to compare two or more states directly. I also wanted to improve the speed of the tool and the problem of bugging. That said, my goal with this project was to learn how to use shiny, and I have. Any more work I would put in I feel would not be time efficient. Learning python is now my next goal.
